Review
======

For each of these, copy the code to a blank program. Then fill out the top part so that the bottom
part works. Do not modify the bottom part in any way. Do not indent it or put it in a function. You are
writing functions (or classes) in the top part that will satisfy all the tests in the bottom part.

Question 1
----------

If you need help for this question, go back and review returning values from functions.

.. literalinclude:: test_01.py
    :caption: test_01.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

Question 2
----------

.. literalinclude:: test_02.py
    :caption: test_02.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

Question 3
----------

This involves both division and addition.

.. literalinclude:: test_03.py
    :caption: test_03.py
    :language: python
    :linenos:

Question 4
----------

Make sure the next one works for other temperatures, not just the ones we test.
The function you write will not print anything, just return the proper value.

Question 5
----------

Make sure the next one works for other values, not just the ones we test.
This question does not involve any printing, just returning.

.. literalinclude:: test_05.py

Question 6
----------

If you need to, go back and review classes.
