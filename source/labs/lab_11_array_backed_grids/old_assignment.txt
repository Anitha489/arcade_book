**Part 2: 10 pts.** Write a celebrity-finding function.
Start with a function check_celebrity that takes an ``n`` by ``n`` matrix named grid as
a parameter.
The grid location ``grid[i][j] = 1`` if person ``i`` knows person ``j``
and ``grid[i][j] = 0`` otherwise.
(Assume that ``grid[i][i] = 1`` for every ``i``, since every person knows him/herself.)
A celebrity is a person who is known by everyone and does not know anyone besides him/herself.
Write a function that given the matrix grid, prints all the celebrities.

For example, in the following grid person 2 is a celebrity:

.. image:: example_1.png
    :width: 150px

In the next example no one is a celebrity:

.. code-block:: text

         0  1  2  3  4
      ----------------
    0 |  1  1  1  0  1
    1 |  0  1  1  0  1
    2 |  0  0  1  0  0
    3 |  1  0  1  1  1
    4 |  1  0  0  1  1

Remember: A matrix can be represented as a list-of-lists, where each sub-list
is a row of the matrix. For example, the first matrix can be represented as:

.. code-block:: text

    grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0], [0, 1, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1, 1] ]

Or you can use multiple lines to define the grid:

.. code-block:: text

    grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0],
             [0, 1, 1, 0],
             [0, 0, 1, 0],
             [1, 0, 1, 1] ]

You can test your function with code like the following test cases:

.. code-block:: text


    # Put your "check_celebrity" function below this line

    # The code will test your function

    print("Test 1, Should show #2 is a celebrity.")
    grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0],
             [0, 1, 1, 0],
             [0, 0, 1, 0],
             [1, 0, 1, 1] ]

    check_celebrity(grid)

    print("Test 2, Should show no one is a celebrity.")
    grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
             [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
             [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
             [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
             [1, 0, 0, 1, 1] ]

    check_celebrity(grid)

    print("Test 3, Should show #2 is a celebrity.")
    grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
             [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
             [0, 0, 1, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
             [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] ]

    check_celebrity(grid)

    print("Test 4, Should show no one is a celebrity.")
    grid = [ [1, 1, 1, 0, 1],
             [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
             [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
             [0, 0, 1, 0, 1],
             [1, 0, 1, 1, 1] ]

    check_celebrity(grid)
