Foreword - Why Learn Programming?
=================================

Programming is consistently one of the top paid skills that you can learn.
Try searching for "Top Paid Majors". Engineering,
computer science, and actuarial science have consistently ranked at the top.
Computer science is also one of the most
flexible majors you can get, because it is in demand in almost any industry
and any location.

Even if programming isn't going to be your main job, as a skill it can
still enhance your career. Need an interactive website? Need to crunch
sales numbers? What about automatically saving the data and graphing the
results of your latest experiment? You might need to run 100 different
simulations of a mathematical model. Or maybe you want your home to
automatically e-mail you if the garage door is left open more than
twenty minutes.

Programming Is Fun
------------------

With programming you get to *create*. People paint and perform music to create
and express themselves.

.. epigraph::

    Picasso had a saying. He said, "Good artists copy, great artists steal."
    And we have always been shameless about stealing great ideas and I think
    part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were
    musicians and poets and artists and zoologists and historians who also happened
    to be the best computer scientists in the world.

    *Steve Jobs in PBS's "Triumph of the Nerds: The Rise of Accidental Empires" (1996)*

Not only do you get to be an artist when you program, but you get to design.

.. epigraph::

    Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of
    course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works. The design of the Mac
    wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was
    how it worked.

    *Steve Jobs in Wired's "The Next Insanely Great Thing" (1996)*

Programming Pays Well
---------------------

Search up "top paid majors" and you'll see computer science is usually one
of the top paid degrees you can get.

The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) says that Computer Science
is the second best paid degree (as of Jan 2018) that you can get. Engineering
is number one.

`Payscale breaks the engineering degrees out, and puts computer science at #14 <https://www.payscale.com/college-salary-report/majors-that-pay-you-back/bachelors>`_.
The other top-paid majors, such as engineering and mathematics, all use
programming extensively.

In addition we'll teach the topics of a typical first-semester programming class.
But the most important thing is for you to find out if programming is
worth your time.

.. note::
    In :ref:`how-to-draw` we show how to create your first graphics.
    These first chapters we show you how to get your computer set up.

What Other Students Have Made
-----------------------------

Here are some videos of games students have created in prior semesters.
Students who didn't know any programming, were able to create these games
by the time they finished the semester.
