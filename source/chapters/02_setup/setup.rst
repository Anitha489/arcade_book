Setting Up Your System
======================

Before you begin programming, we need to install a few things.
Using a school computer? Yay! You may have these already installed.
Still, read through this part, as you might need to set up your own
system in the future.

Getting a system set up and ready to program can be a bit frustrating.
**Don't give up.** Once you've got a system set up for programming you
don't need to think about it again. You can concentrate on the programming part.
It is normal to get stuck during setup, so don't hesitate to reach out and get help.


Your development computer will need:

* The Python_ programming language and the Arcade_ code library.
* An editor to type in your programs. (We'll use a program called PyCharm_.
  You can use the community edition for free, or if you have an email
  address that ends in ``.edu`` get can get a free `student license`_ for
  the professional version.)
* A version control system to track and turn in your work. (Git_)
* A minor configuration tweak so we can see file extensions.

Setup the Programming Environment
---------------------------------

To get your computer ready for programming we need to install the Python computer language,
and an editor you can type your programs into.

Installing Python
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We will be using the "Python_" computer programming language.
The creator of Python was a fan of `Monty Python`_, hence the name.

.. _Monty Python: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python


In addition to the Python language, we are going to use a library of commands
for drawing on the screen. This is called the "Arcade" library.

Installation for installing Python and the Arcade library are available below:

* `Windows Installation <http://arcade.academy/installation_windows.html>`_
  (Make sure to read the instructions carefully. Do not skip the "Add Python
  to Path" step. This seems to be the most frequent issue.)
* `Mac Installation <http://arcade.academy/installation_mac.html>`_
* `Linux Installation <http://arcade.academy/installation_linux.html>`_

Installing an IDE
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We also need an editor. Python comes with an editor called IDLE, but it is
awful and not worth using. We'll use an editor called PyCharm.

PyCharm is a powerful program that lets you do more than just edit the
program, it also includes a large set of tools that programmers need. This
type of environment is called an **Integrated Development Environment**, or **IDE**
for short.

Download and install PyCharm_.
You can use their community edition for free. We won't use the
features in the professional edition. If you decide to
pick the professional edition anyway,
you'll need a license to use it.
But licenses are free for educational use!
If you have an e-mail that ends in ``.edu`` you can
ask for a `student license`_. It can be used on a school computer, or on your own
computer.

Viewing File Extensions
-----------------------

It is a great idea to change your windows configuration to show file extensions.
A file usually has a name like Book ``report.docx`` where the ``.docx`` tells the
computer it is a Microsoft Word compatible document. By default Windows
hides the ``.docx`` extension if there is a program installed to handle it.
If you are programming, this hiding part of the file name can be annoying.


For Windows 8 and 10, bring up a file explorer by hitting the Windows-E key.
Then click the "view" tab and make sure "File name extensions" has been checked.
